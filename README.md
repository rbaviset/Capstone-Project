# 1. Business Understanding
The increasing complexity and volatility of global supply chains subject the sourcing function to constant, high-impact risks, including sudden supplier financial failures, geopolitical trade disruptions, and chronic supply shortages.
Traditional sourcing strategy process is constrained by its inability to synthesize millions of dynamic, heterogeneous data points across global supplier networks. Sourcing managers are overwhelmed trying to manually integrate internal operational performance data with fragmented external intelligence on technology roadmaps, financial health, geopolitical instability, and ESG goals. This results in delayed strategy updates and decisions based on incomplete, outdated information.
AI transforms the sourcing strategy process from a fragmented, data-intensive effort into a holistic, real-time data-driven approach. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), AI synthesizes all internal and external data into a dynamic Knowledge Graph and real-time Supplier Health Score. This shift allows leaders to focus on  strategic discussions with Business Units for enabling supply base resilience and optimized Total Cost of Ownership.

# 2. Data Understanding
The historical supplier dataset integrates multiple internal and external dimensions critical for sourcing strategy:
* Operational: Cost, Quality and Delivery performance data gathered through a combination of internal ERP and custom applications.
  Cost Savings (%), PPV, QP, QR, Lead Time Attainment
* Financial: Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Current Ratio, Cash Flow from Balance sheet, Income statement, Cash flow statements.
  Revenue,COGS, Cash Flow, Gross Margin %, Debt-to-Equity
* Geopolitical: Political instability, Natural disaster vulnerability, or Trade regulations from World Bank and World Trade Organization.
  Geo Risk Index, Tariff Risk, Chip Shortage Impact
* Compliance: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics, highlighting achievements from Supplier Purpose report.
  Renewable Energy Usage, Plastic Recycling, Human Rights Compliance
* Technology Roadmap: Alignment with Future DRAM Nodes (e.g., DDR5/HBM progress mentioned in Microelectronics and Advanced Packaging Technologies (MAPT).
  DDR Generation Support, Node Parity
